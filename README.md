# Library.Fronend

Passed dev issues:
- create react ts app
- add some component (e.g. Authors, Author and Book pages)
- using redux
  - add store and simple reducers
  - got a problem with like 'Argument of type 'typeof App' is not assignable to parameter of type 'ComponentType<never>'.'
  but we are typed App props interface and use it...

Next dev steps:
-create all reducers 
-create create and edit pages
-remake overview pages...
